    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rxRZPHxF7253qTCbkzUkai1VLiIWEJTnlvapFU5sL_8/">Seindral</a> - This is just a story I begun writing in Decemeber of 2024.
    <br/>The story takes place in the typical fantasy world. Adventurer Parties, Demons, Elves, Dwarves, Humans, Mages, etc.
    <br/>And starts in a cave, where the party of a female human mage Andriela, are fighting the inhabitants of the cave, a horde of goblins and hobgoblins. And things are not working out the best for them. And when she thought things were finally about to be brought to an end for her, someone intervenes. But the person who stepped in, was the last person Andriela expected...
